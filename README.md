# Spatiotemporal Distribution and Risk Assessment of Heat Waves Based on Apparent Temperature in Eurasia

Using daily meteorological monitoring data to calculate the daily apparent temperature and annual heat wave dataset for 1989–2018 in Eurasia.

Heat waves seriously affect the productivity and daily life of human beings. Therefore, they bring great risks and uncertainties for the further development of countries in Eurasia. 

In this study, we used daily meteorological monitoring data to calculate the daily apparent temperature and annual heat wave dataset for 1989–2018 in Eurasia. Then, we studied their spatiotemporal distribution patterns. Additionally, multi-source data were used to assess heat wave risk in Eurasia.
